Cobra Kai Cloud Migration Strategy and Implementation
This project provides a comprehensive strategy for migrating the Cobra Kai application from an on-premise infrastructure to AWS cloud services. The migration addresses several critical issues with the existing architecture, including the lack of a backup strategy, vulnerability to DDoS attacks, slow streaming performance, and the inability to scale based on demand.

The document outlines the proposed architecture and key AWS services that will be leveraged to ensure a seamless, secure, and cost-effective cloud migration. The solution focuses on achieving high availability, resilience, enhanced performance, and improved security while maintaining PCI DSS compliance.

Key Issues in Current Architecture:
No backup and recovery strategy.
No scaling mechanisms to handle increased demand.
Vulnerability to DDoS attacks.
Non-PCI compliant infrastructure.
Slow streaming and poor application performance.
Cloud Migration Advantages:
On-demand scalability to manage dynamic traffic.
High availability through multi-AZ (Availability Zone) failover.
Cost reduction by eliminating upfront infrastructure investments.
Continuous monitoring and performance optimization.
Real-time DDoS protection and enhanced application security.
User access management with fine-grained access control.
Key AWS Components Used:
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Provides a virtual network isolated from other AWS resources to host the Cobra Kai application. Subnets, routing tables, and security groups ensure network-level security and resource availability.

Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling: Scalable computing resources, automatically adjusting to meet demand. The Auto Scaling Group ensures consistent performance by replacing unhealthy instances automatically.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Cloud storage for media content, ensuring on-demand access and reliable streaming. Ideal for storing application assets and backups.

Amazon Route 53: A scalable DNS service that manages domain registration and routes traffic efficiently to the application. It also provides health checks to monitor application availability.

AWS CloudFront: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the globe, reducing latency and ensuring fast access for users. It also provides DDoS protection.

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Granular access control for AWS resources. IAM roles and policies are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access Cobra Kai application resources.

AWS Shield and AWS WAF: Provides robust DDoS protection and application-level security, safeguarding the application from attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

Security Measures:
Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) and Security Groups: Implemented at the subnet and instance level to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring network security.

AWS Shield: Protects against sophisticated DDoS attacks, minimizing downtime and maintaining application availability.

AWS GuardDuty: Provides continuous threat detection and monitors malicious activity or unauthorized behavior within the environment.

AWS Macie: Automates the discovery and protection of sensitive data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

PCI DSS Compliance:
The migration plan also addresses PCI DSS compliance requirements by encrypting sensitive data in transit and at rest, automating patch management, and implementing strict access controls to protect payment data.

Monitoring and Logging:
AWS CloudWatch: Real-time monitoring and alerting for system performance metrics, logs, and application insights.

AWS Inspector: Continuously scans EC2 instances for known vulnerabilities and security issues.

Backup and Disaster Recovery:
AWS Backup: Provides automated backups across AWS services, enabling disaster recovery and minimizing data loss risks. A backup plan with scheduled backups ensures data is always recoverable in case of failure.
Deployment and Infrastructure as Code:
AWS CloudFormation: Enables infrastructure management through code, allowing rapid replication of the environment. CloudFormation templates are used to automate the provisioning and configuration of resources.
Additional AWS Services:
Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service for Cobra Kaiâ€™s database needs, offering automated backups, patching, and scaling.

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

How to Run the Project:
Set up an AWS account and configure access to AWS services (VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFront, Route 53).
Use the provided CloudFormation templates to automate the deployment of infrastructure.
Configure AWS Backup and IAM roles for appropriate access control and security.
Monitor the application using CloudWatch and ensure logs and metrics are captured.
Deploy the application with Auto Scaling to manage fluctuating traffic.
